# __Riding Trends: Exploring Citi Bike Fall 2022__

## __Background__

Welcome to Riding Trends, an exploration of the New York Citi Bike program! The goal was to generate comprehensive reports for city officials to enhance and publicize the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. Despite the program's robust data collection since 2013, the absence of a sophisticated reporting process led to the creation of this set of data reports.

## __Data Source__

The project utilizes trip data from September, October, and November of Fall 2022, sampled at a random 20% for visualization purposes. The selected files from the Citi Bike Data source were instrumental in deriving insights for this analysis.

## __Visualizations Completed__

- Number of Trips vs. Day of the Month
- Number of Trips vs. Time of Day
- Number of Trips vs. Day of the Week
- Ride Type (electric bike, docked bike, classic bike) vs. Number of Trips
- Individual Station Activity
- Relationship Between Ride Type, Month, and Trip Duration
- Most Popular Starting Stations
- Most Popular Ending Stations
